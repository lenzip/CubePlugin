* GGS GEOMETRY EXAMPLE *
************************

This example shows how to create a simple Geant4 geometry and pack it into a GGS plugin geometry library. The geometry
consists of two cubes aligned along the Z axis, with the face of the first cube at Z=0 and the second cube placed in the Z<0
region. The first cube is made of PVT while the second one of BGO; they are put in a world volume filled by air. GGS materials
have been used.

The geometry parameters can be tuned using the following geometry datacard commands:

   /GGS/examples/geometry/GeoExample/size1
   /GGS/examples/geometry/GeoExample/size2
   /GGS/examples/geometry/GeoExample/distance

They set the size of cube 1, of cube 2, and the distance between the faces of the two cubes, respectively. The default values for
these parameters are 5, 20 and 10 cm, respectively.

The geometry implements an acceptance check routine in the GeoExample::IsInsideAcceptance method. The instrument acceptance
is simply defined by the face of the first cube at Z=0 for particles shot from the Z>0 region and traveling towards Z<0.

+ BUILD +
+++++++++

This example comes with its own CMakeLists.txt and can be independently built. To build it, follow these instructions:

- create a build directory wherever you prefer, with any name
- cd to the build directory
- cmake /path/to/GGSSSoftware/examples/geometry
- make all

Inside the build directory, the example geometry library (libGeoExample.so) can now be found.
