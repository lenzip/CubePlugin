* GGS EXAMPLES *
****************

This folder contains various examples of GGS usage. Each of them can be built separately and illustrate a feature of GGS.
Available examples:

geometry
--------
    This example shows how to create a plugin geometry for GGS, including a messenger for geometry configuration
    and an acceptance check routine to be used with the GGS gun event generator.
    
useraction
----------
    An example of definition of a plugin user action.
    
scoring
-------
    In this example, a sensitive detector and a user action for data persistency are implemented and packed into a
    single user action.
    
analysis
--------
    An example about how to run a simulation and analyze the produced data with a ROOT script. Requires the geometry
    defined in the geometry example.
    
    
Please refer to the README file inside each directory for more information about a specific example.

Each example (except analysis) comes with its own CMakeLists.txt and can be independently built. To build all the examples
at once use the CMakeLists.txt in this folder and follow these instructions:

- create a build directory wherever you prefer, with any name
- cd to the build directory
- cmake /path/to/GGSSSoftware/examples
- make all

Inside the build directory, a "geometry" folder containing the example geometry library (libGeoExample.so) can now be found, 
and similarly for other examples.
