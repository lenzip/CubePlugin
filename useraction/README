* GGS USER ACTION EXAMPLE *
***************************

This example shows how to create a simple GGS user action which dumps the number of particles produced in each event
on a text file. In the constructor of the UserActionExample class a messenger is created to set the name of the output file
using the command:

   /GGS/examples/useraction/UserActionExample/outFileName

The default name of the output file is UserActionExample.txt.

The UserActionExample::BeginOfRunAction initializes the header of the output file. At the end of each event the number
of particles is dumped on the file by the UserActionExample::EndOfEventAction method. Finally, when the run ends, the method
UserActionExample::EndOfRunAction will close the output file. The destructor will delete the messenger.

In UserActionExample.cpp, notice the usage of the macro RegisterUA: this macro, taking as argument the name of the class, is 
required in order to create a plugin library with a user action class that can be created at runtime as explained in the 
following.   

The action can be used with GGSPenny by loading its library with the -ua command line option for GGSPenny. Like all the other
GGS user actions, it is not built by default, so the user has to create it with the datacard command:

   /GGS/userActions/addUserActionExample

The creation command must be issued before the file name setting command.

+ BUILD +
+++++++++

This example comes with its own CMakeLists.txt and can be independently built. To build it, follow these instructions:

- create a build directory wherever you prefer, with any name
- cd to the build directory
- cmake /path/to/GGSSSoftware/examples/geometry
- make all

Inside the build directory, the example user action library (libUserActionExample.so) can now be found.
