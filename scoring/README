* GGS SCORING EXAMPLE *
***********************

In this example a simple sensitive detector is created, together with a user action which saves the scoring informations 
on a text file.

The SDScoringExample sensitive detector class computes the total energy release in each physical volume associated to the
logical volume to which the SD is attached. The SD can be assigned to a logical volume with the command:

   /GGS/scoring/addSDScoringExample <logVolName>

where <logVolName> is the name of the logical volume passed as command argument. A datacard command:

   /GGS/examples/scoring/SDScoringExample/<LogVolName>/onlyNeutral
    
will then become available and can be used to register only the energy deposited by neutral particles for the specified
volume. Notice the usage of the RegisterSD macro in SDScoringExample.cpp in order to make the SD assignment command
available after loading the plugin library. The SD will create a hit collection named "<logVolName>.SDScoringExample" in
order to not being confused with other hit collections created by eventual other SD for the same volume.

The energy releases are stored in instances of the HitScoringExample class, a child of G4VHit. Each object have a field
to record the name of the physical volume and a field for its associated energy release. The UAScoringExample user action
process the hits at the end of each event and dumps them on the text file. Notice how in EndOfEventAction it checks for the
presence of the ".SDScoringExample" string in the names of the hit collections, in order to identify the hits produced
by the SDScoringExample sensitive detector class. Like all the GGS user actions, it is not built by default and must be
created at runtime with the command:

   /GGS/userActions/addUAScoringExample
   
After this, it will be possible to change the name of the output file with:

   /GGS/examples/scoring/UAScoringExample/outFileName
  
All the classes in this examples will be put into a single library called libScoringExample.so, which must be loaded using
the -ua command line options of GGSPenny.

+++++++++

This example comes with its own CMakeLists.txt and can be independently built. To build it, follow these instructions:

- create a build directory wherever you prefer, with any name
- cd to the build directory
- cmake /path/to/GGSSSoftware/examples/geometry
- make all

Inside the build directory, the example scoring library (libScoringExample.so) can now be found.
